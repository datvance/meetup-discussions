<p><b>scott r braithwaite on Feb 6:</b> Hi!  I’m coming from DC next week the 12th and 13th and plan to ride Brek and Vail. I’m an avid boarder and like to go hard all day. Don’t mind going solo but if anyone else is going or interested in going it would be cool to ride with someone. Anyone want to meet up?  Thanks.<br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/Ski-CO/discussions/6755397670416179/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/Ski-CO/discussions/6755397670416179/chat/</a></p>

<p><b>Andrew Visano on Feb 6:</b> Hoping to goto Copper tomorrow leaving Lakewood around 645am.  I've seen the forecast and know snow is expected started around 5am with the heaviest starting late afternoon.  Based on that forecast, would anybody expect I-70 to be an issue driving back towards Denver around 2pm?  When do they close it?<br/><br/>Also could carpool or drive if anybody is interested.<br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415693/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415693/chat/</a></p>

<p><b>Fernando on Jan 22:</b> Hi all - I live downtown Denver, on Capitol Hill. I have the Ikon pass and I am interested in finding friends I could carpool with to any of the resorts. I have a flexible work schedule. I don't have a car, but I can of course pitch for gas, help driving and provide good conversation!

<p><b>Andrew Visano on Feb 6:</b> Hoping to goto Copper tomorrow leaving Lakewood around 645am.  I've seen the forecast and know snow is expected started around 5am with the heaviest starting late afternoon.  Based on that forecast, would anybody expect I-70 to be an issue driving back towards Denver around 2pm?  When do they close it?<br/><br/>Also could carpool or drive if anybody is interested.<br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415693/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415693/chat/</a></p>

<p><b>Andrea Jaques on Jan 7:</b> Hi all! I just moved to Denver and am looking for some ski/board buddies. I've got the Ikon pass and was thinking of heading to Winter Park on Saturday for the day. I'll ski whatever but if given the choice will typically stick to glades and blacks. My car can take up to 4 people total, 3 comfortably, with gear.

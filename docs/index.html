<p><b>Andrea J. on Jan 7:</b> Hi all! I just moved to Denver and am looking for some ski/board buddies. I've got the Ikon pass and was thinking of heading to Winter Park on Saturday for the day. I'll ski whatever but if given the choice will typically stick to glades and blacks. However, totally down for carpooling together and just grabbing a drink afterward too. My car can take up to 4 people total, 3 comfortably, with gear. Please let me know if any are interested!<br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670338033/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670338033/chat/</a></p>

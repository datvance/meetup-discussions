<p><b>Andrew V. on Feb 6:</b> Hoping to goto Copper tomorrow leaving Lakewood around 645am.  I've seen the forecast and know snow is expected started around 5am with the heaviest starting late afternoon.

When do they close it?<br/><br/>Also could carpool or drive if anybody is interested.<br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415693/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415693/chat/</a></p>

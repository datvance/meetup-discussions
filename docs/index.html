<p><b>Andrew V. on Feb 6:</b> Hoping to goto Copper tomorrow leaving Lakewood around 645am.

When do they close it?<br/><br/>Also could carpool or drive if anybody is interested.<br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415692/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415692/chat/</a></p>

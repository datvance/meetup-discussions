<p><b>scott r braithwaite on Feb 6:</b> Hi!  I’m coming from DC next week the 12th and 13th and plan to ride Brek and Vail. I’m an avid boarder and like to go hard all day. Don’t mind going solo but if anyone else is going or interested in going it would be cool to ride with someone. Anyone want to meet up?  Thanks.<br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/Ski-CO/discussions/6755397670416179/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/Ski-CO/discussions/6755397670416179/chat/</a></p>

<p><b>Andrew Visano on Feb 6:</b> Hoping to goto Copper tomorrow leaving Lakewood around 645am.  I've seen the forecast and know snow is expected started around 5am with the heaviest starting late afternoon.  Based on that forecast, would anybody expect I-70 to be an issue driving back towards Denver around 2pm?  When do they close it?<br/><br/>Also could carpool or drive if anybody is interested.<br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415693/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/IKON-Ski-Board/discussions/6755397670415693/chat/</a></p>

<p><b>Andrea Jaques on Jan 7:</b> Hi all! I just moved to Denver and am looking for some ski/board buddies. I've got the Ikon pass and was thinking of heading to Winter Park on Saturday for the day. I'll ski whatever but if given the choice will typically stick to glades and blacks. My car can take up to 4 people total, 3 comfortably, with gear. Please let me know if any are interested!<br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/ODCO4Fun/discussions/6755397670337469/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/ODCO4Fun/discussions/6755397670337469/chat/</a></p>

<p><b>Kreighton on Nov 14:</b> Hi, curious if anyone else has the Loveland pass and/or interest in getting up there for some early season turns. It's not much farther than Eldora and I go in the afternoon and there are zero lines; just lapping into the chair.  I'm available every other weekend and some weekdays (this holds in general, across the other mountains).

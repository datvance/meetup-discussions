  <p><b>Nicholas S. on Mar 19:</b> Here is some info in case you'd like to volunteer and / or donate to Colorado's COVID-19 relief fund. The Colorado COVID Relief Fund is hosted by the State of Colorado and Mile High United Way. The fund will be overseen by a committee of community leaders from across Colorado and will be providing aid to support Colorado communities and organizations affected by the recent outbreak of COVID-19. Funds will provide flexible resources to organizations in our state working with communities who are disproportionately impacted by the outbreak.<br/><br/><a class="link" href="http://www.HelpColoradoNow.org" title="www.HelpColoradoNow.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.HelpColoradoNow.org</a><br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/Denver-Snowboarding-Meetup-EPIC-IKON-and-more/discussions/6755397670520020/chat/' rel='nofollow'>/Denver-Snowboarding-Meetup-EPIC-IKON-and-more/discussions/6755397670520020/chat/</a></p>
